1. Did you start your function defintion with "def" ?
		def phuong_minh(abcd)
		
2. Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?
	- NEVER use number to start a function name: 
		def 1minhphuong(abcd) ======> FALSE.
		
3. Did you put an open parenthesis (right after the function name ?

4. Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis ( separated by commas?

5. Did you make each arguments unique (meaning no duplicated names?)
	- In one function, it's necessary to create UNIQUE arguments.
	- In the different functions, it isn't. (example my ex18.py)

6. Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon ): after the arguments?

*7. Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function FOUR SPACES?
No more, no less. 
	- Or you can use ONE TAB instead.

8. Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent
(dedenting we can it)?
	- It means: you need an ENTER between 2 function
	- Don't use: def dinhphuong(abcd):
					 print" abcd = %r" % 1234
				 def phuongminh(abcd):
					 print" abcd = %r" %5678

And when you run ("use" or "call") a function, check these things:
1. Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?

2. Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?

3. Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?

4. Did you end the function call with a ) character?

Use these two checklist on the remaining lessons until you do not need them
anymore. Finally, repeat this a few times: 
"To 'run', 'call', or 'use' a function all mean the same thing."
